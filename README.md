# Vagrant Tutorial

This repository is the [counterpart for a tutorial on my website](https://danielgroves.net/notebook/2014/05/development-environments/ "Vagrant and Ansible Development ENvironments"). It probably won't be actively maintained in the long run.

If you're a PHP user checkout the PHP branch, the master branch targets Python/Django setups.

It would also be wise to read the license within the repository before doing anything with it.
